WHMMAW
Wall Heat Metal Air Wall

Heat is metal that has set temprature [heatTemp] // not yet a function, but could be swapped in later

Air is reset to ambient temp each round [ambientTemp]

Functions:
	bool updateFlows(cellCount, temps[], flows[], materials[], matRef[]); //Feel free to mess with args
	bool updateTemps(cellCount, currentTemps[], newTemps[], flows[], materials[], matRef[]);
	uint16_t heatTemp (material, currentTemp, flow); //Returns the cell's new temperature

Variables:
	newTemp
	currTemp
	materials (constant)
	flows


Define:
	matRef[]
	heaterTemp
	airTemp


Data types:
	uint16_t // 16-bit unsigned integer, old way of storing temperatures
		-128 C = 0
      		0C = 32768
		127 + 255/256 C = 65535
		Resolution is about 0.004 C

	int16_t // 16-bit signed integer, one option for flow power (because negative is a thing)
		Power range could be -16 W to 15 + 2047/2048 W
		Resolution is about 0.5mW, which is a gradient of about 2.5C -- too high!
		
	int32_t // 32-bit signed integer, probably the right option for flow power and temperature
		Power:
		Power range could be -32 W to ~32W
		Resolution is 2^-26 W ~= 1.5 * 10^-8 w, which is a very small gradient
		Temperature:
		Center at 0C
		-256 C < temp < ~256 C
		Resolution is around 1/8,000,000 C
		 


Rough values:
      Distance between cells = 1mm
      Time step = 10ms
      Conductivity of aluminum = 205 w/M*K   //Value taken at 25C, probably close enough across our range
      Conductivity of air = 0.024 w/M*K
      A 50C gradient in aluminum, with 1mm cubes, gives 10.25W of flow
